      <h6>MISS TESMAN.</h6>
       <p>Why, of course I had to come and see how you were getting on.</p>
       <h6>TESMAN.</h6>
       <p>In spite of your having had no proper night's rest?</p>
       <h6>MISS TESMAN.</h6>
       <p>Oh, that makes no difference to me.</p>
       <h6>TESMAN.</h6>
       <p>Well, I suppose you got home all right from the pier? Eh?</p>
       <h6>MISS TESMAN.</h6>
       <p>Yes, quite safely, thank goodness. Judge Brack was good enough to see me right to my door.</p>
       <h6>TESMAN.</h6>
       <p>We were so sorry we couldn't give you a seat in the carriage. But you
       saw what a pile of boxes Hedda had to bring with her.</p>
       <h6>MISS TESMAN.</h6>
       <p>Yes, she had certainly plenty of boxes.</p>
       <h6>BERTA.</h6>
      <p>[To TESMAN.] Shall I go in and see if there's anything I can do for the
        mistress?</p>
      <h6>TESMAN.</h6>
      <p>No thank you, Berta--you needn't. She said she would ring if she wanted anything.</p>
      <h6>BERTA.</h6>
      <p>[Going towards the right.] Very well.</p>
      <h6>TESMAN.</h6>
      <p>But look here--take this portmanteau with you.</p>
      <h6>BERTA.</h6>
      <p>[Taking it.] I'll put it in the attic.
      [She goes out by the hall door.</p>
