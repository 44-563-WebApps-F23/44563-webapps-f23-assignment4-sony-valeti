    <p>MISS TESMAN.
       Why, of course I had to come and see how you were getting on.
       TESMAN.
       In spite of your having had no proper night's rest?
       MISS TESMAN.
       Oh, that makes no difference to me.
       TESMAN.
       Well, I suppose you got home all right from the pier? Eh?
       MISS TESMAN.
       Yes, quite safely, thank goodness. Judge Brack was good enough to see me right to my door.
       TESMAN.
       We were so sorry we couldn't give you a seat in the carriage. But you
       saw what a pile of boxes Hedda had to bring with her.
       MISS TESMAN.
       Yes, she had certainly plenty of boxes.
       BERTA.
      [To TESMAN.] Shall I go in and see if there's anything I can do for the
        mistress?
      TESMAN.
      No thank you, Berta--you needn't. She said she would ring if she wanted anything.
      BERTA.
      [Going towards the right.] Very well.
      TESMAN.
      But look here--take this portmanteau with you.
      BERTA.
      [Taking it.] I'll put it in the attic.
      [She goes out by the hall door.
