    <p>MISS TESMAN.
       Why, of course I had to come and see how you were getting on.<br>
       TESMAN.
       In spite of your having had no proper night's rest?<br>
       MISS TESMAN.
       Oh, that makes no difference to me.<br>
       TESMAN.
       Well, I suppose you got home all right from the pier? Eh?<br>
       MISS TESMAN.
       Yes, quite safely, thank goodness. Judge Brack was good enough to see me right to my door.<br>
       TESMAN.
       We were so sorry we couldn't give you a seat in the carriage. But you
       saw what a pile of boxes Hedda had to bring with her.<br>
       MISS TESMAN.
       Yes, she had certainly plenty of boxes.<br>
       BERTA.
      [To TESMAN.] Shall I go in and see if there's anything I can do for the
        mistress?<br>
      TESMAN.
      No thank you, Berta--you needn't. She said she would ring if she wanted anything.<br>
      BERTA.
      [Going towards the right.] Very well.<br>
      TESMAN.
      But look here--take this portmanteau with you.<br>
      BERTA.
      [Taking it.] I'll put it in the attic.<br>
      [She goes out by the hall door.
