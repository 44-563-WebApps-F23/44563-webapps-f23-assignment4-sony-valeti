       <p class="speech">Why, of course I had to come and see how you were getting on.</p>
       <h6 class="TESMAN">TESMAN.</h6>
       <p class="speech">In spite of your having had no proper night's rest?</p>
       <h6 class="MISSTESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h6>
       <p class="speech">Oh, that makes no difference to me.</p>
       <h6 class="TESMAN">TESMAN.</h6>
       <p class="speech">Well, I suppose you got home all right from the pier? Eh?</p>
       <h6 class="MISSTESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h6>
       <p class="speech">Yes, quite safely, thank goodness. Judge Brack was good enough to see me right to my door.</p>
       <h6 class="TESMAN">TESMAN.</h6>
       <p class="speech">We were so sorry we couldn't give you a seat in the carriage. But you
       saw what a pile of boxes Hedda had to bring with her.</p>
       <h6 class="MISSTESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h6>
       <p class="speech">Yes, she had certainly plenty of boxes.</p>
       <h6 class="BERTA">BERTA.</h6>
      <p class="direction">[To TESMAN.]</p>
      <p class="speech"> Shall I go in and see if there's anything I can do for the mistress?</p>
      <h6 class="TESMAN">TESMAN.</h6>
      <p>No thank you, Berta--you needn't. She said she would ring if she wanted anything.</p>
      <h6 class="BERTA">BERTA.</h6>
      <p>[Going towards the right.]</p>
        <p class="speech"> Very well.</p>
      <h6 class="TESMAN">TESMAN.</h6>
      <p class="speech">But look here--take this portmanteau with you.</p>
      <h6 class="BERTA">BERTA.</h6>
      <p class="direction">[Taking it.]</p>
      <p class="speech">I'll put it in the attic.</p> 
      <p class="direction">[She goes out by the hall door].</p>
